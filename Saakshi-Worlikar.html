    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Drawn to experience and discovery, she finds meaning in watching films, capturing moments through photography,
      and exploring new places—never passing up good food along the journey.
      A reader by nature, she values knowledge as deeply as action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Academically forged with an MSc in Zoology and a B.Ed, she carries both discipline and insight,
      balancing intellect, instinct, and purpose with quiet confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grounded yet observant, she moves with the calm awareness of a seasoned warrior—
      watchful, thoughtful, and always prepared.
