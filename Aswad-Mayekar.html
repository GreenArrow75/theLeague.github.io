    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Always among the first to step forward, he believes leadership is not claimed but demonstrated.
      Service comes naturally to him—showing up, standing visible, and setting the standard when it matters most.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond duty, he finds balance in reading, writing, quiet observation-
      pursuits that sharpen his awareness and deepen his appreciation for beauty in motion and stillness alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disciplined in action and hyper-active in thought, he values continuous relationship development and intentional presence.
      Every interaction is approached with care, clarity, and purpose—never rushed, never unattended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fueled by willpower. Guided by principle. Consistently involved.
    </p>
